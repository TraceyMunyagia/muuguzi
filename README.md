# muuguzi_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Backend evaluation (placeholder)

A minimal, dependency-free evaluation script lives in `backend/evaluate_model.py`. It uses a toy rule-based model and embedded dataset so you can print an accuracy metric locally. Run:

```bash
cd backend
python evaluate_model.py
```

Swap out the toy model and `DATASET` with your real model and evaluation data when ready.
